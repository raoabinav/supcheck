# Supabase Compliance Tool: Project Overview

## 1. Project Vision

The Supabase Compliance Tool is a comprehensive solution designed to help developers audit, monitor, and enforce security best practices in their Supabase projects. It provides automated checks for critical security configurations including Row Level Security (RLS), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR), and other essential security measures.

### 2.2 Component Breakdown

#### 2.2.1 Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Dashboard**: Main interface showing compliance status across all checks
- **Authentication**: Login/signup flows with Supabase Auth integration
- **Compliance Checks**: Individual modules for each security check
- **Reporting**: Visualization of compliance status and recommendations
- **Configuration**: Settings for API keys and project preferences

#### 2.2.2 Backend Services
- **Supabase Client**: JavaScript client for interacting with Supabase
- **Management API**: For administrative operations (PITR status, etc.)
- **Database Access Layer**: For direct database queries when needed

#### 2.2.3 Data Storage
- **Local Storage**: For persisting user preferences and API keys
- **Supabase Tables**: For storing historical compliance data (optional)

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Security Compliance Checks

#### 3.1.1 Row Level Security (RLS) Check
- Detects tables without RLS enabled
- Provides guidance on implementing proper RLS policies
- Handles edge cases and permission limitations

#### 3.1.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Check
- Verifies MFA configuration for user accounts
- Identifies accounts without MFA enabled
- Provides setup instructions for enabling MFA

#### 3.1.3 Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) Check
- Verifies PITR configuration status
- Checks eligibility based on subscription tier
- Provides guidance on enabling and configuring PITR

### 3.2 User Interface
- Clean, modern dashboard with compliance summary
- Detailed view for each compliance check
- Interactive guidance for resolving issues
- Mobile-responsive design

## 4. Technical Implementation Challenges

### 4.1 RLS Detection Challenges

#### 4.1.1 Approaches Considered

**Direct System Catalog Query:**
- Query `pg_catalog.pg_tables` for the `rowsecurity` flag
- Requires elevated permissions most clients don't have

**Custom SQL Function:**
- Create SQL functions with `SECURITY DEFINER` to access system catalogs
- Deployment complexity and permission requirements

**Heuristic Method (Selected):**
- Attempt to select from tables and infer RLS from permission errors
- Works with standard permissions but less accurate

#### 4.1.2 Selected Implementation
- Query `information_schema.tables` to get all public tables
- For each table, attempt to select data and check for permission errors
- Infer RLS status based on error patterns
- Handle edge cases and provide clear reporting

### 4.2 Authentication and Authorization
- Secure storage of API keys
- Role-based access control for team environments
- Proper handling of Supabase service roles

### 4.3 Performance Considerations
- Minimize API calls to prevent rate limiting
- Implement caching for repeated checks
- Optimize queries for large databases

## 5. Development Roadmap

### 5.1 Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current)
- Basic authentication with Supabase
- Implementation of RLS, MFA, and PITR checks
- Simple dashboard UI
- Local storage for settings

### 5.2 Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Additional compliance checks (API security, backup verification)
- Improved reporting with actionable recommendations
- Scheduled automated checks
- Email notifications for compliance issues

### 5.3 Phase 3: Enterprise Features
- Team collaboration features
- Compliance history tracking
- Custom compliance policies
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

## 6. Technical Design Decisions

### 6.1 Frontend Framework
- **React**: For component-based UI development
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **TailwindCSS**: For responsive and consistent styling

### 6.2 State Management
- **React Context**: For global state management
- **Local Storage**: For persisting user preferences

### 6.3 API Integration
- **Supabase JS Client**: For database and auth operations
- **Fetch API**: For management API calls

### 6.4 Testing Strategy
- **Jest**: For unit testing
- **React Testing Library**: For component testing
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing

## 7. Open Questions and Considerations

### 7.1 RLS Implementation
- How to improve accuracy of heuristic RLS detection?
- Should we offer an optional backend component for more accurate checks?
- How to handle tables with RLS enabled but with permissive policies?

### 7.2 Deployment Model
- Should we offer a hosted SaaS version?
- How to handle self-hosted deployments?
- Integration with existing DevOps workflows?

### 7.3 Security Considerations
- How to securely handle service role keys?
- What permissions should the tool require?
- How to prevent the tool itself from becoming a security risk?

## 8. Conclusion

The Supabase Compliance Tool aims to simplify security compliance for Supabase projects through automated checks and clear guidance. By focusing on critical security features like RLS, MFA, and PITR, the tool helps developers maintain secure applications without requiring deep expertise in database security.

The current implementation prioritizes compatibility and ease of use, with a roadmap for enhancing accuracy and features over time. The heuristic approach to RLS detection represents a practical balance between reliability and permissions requirements, making the tool accessible to all Supabase users regardless of their subscription tier.
